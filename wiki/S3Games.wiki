Welcome to S3 Games project

The aim is to provide an educational framework about playing various games using standard and more advanced Search and Artificial Intelligence algorithms.

The framework allows to specify rules of any game that is based on pick and place moves/actions. It contains general algorithms that can play these games and a framework for adding your own algorithms to experiment with.

The project allows connecting to a Lynxmotion robotic arm with SSC-32 servo controller and a usual webcamera for playing games on real-world game board.

The framework is written in Java programming language.
It was created for group project at [http://www.drustvo-evo.hr/s3/ Summer School of Science] (S3) in Pozega, Croatia, July/August 2013.
