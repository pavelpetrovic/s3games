/** The GameRule class represents a single rule for game moves: from where,
 * to where, and what can be moved, and under what circumstances, as well
 * as what has to be done as follow-up action and how to adjust the player
 * scores, if the rule was applied. The names of element and locations can
 * contain variables - then these are instantiated with the respective indexes
 * of the element/location where the rule is applied. For example a rule
 *   from: loc($X1,$Y1); to: loc($X2,$Y2), element: el($I)
 * will match with any locations named "loc(any_number,any_number)" and
 * any element with name "el(any_number)", and the variables will be filled
 * with the respective indexes for the condition, score, and followup evaluation
 * contexts */
